# Beamer Preamble

Reusable LaTeX preamble for Beamer presentations.

## Purpose

This package provides common configurations and packages used across multiple slide sets:

- Standard packages (tikz, listings, biblatex, etc.)
- Custom commands and macros
- Language and typography settings
- Common configurations

## Usage

In your Beamer document:

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{preamble}
```

## Development

Preamble contents will be added iteratively as common patterns emerge across slide sets.
The goal is to keep slide files clean and focused on content.
